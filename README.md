# BMI Calculator

## Overview
This project is a user-friendly BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator designed with HTML, CSS, and PHP. It allows users to enter their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and provides a clear categorization with visual aids.

## Features
- **Easy-to-use interface**: Simple form for entering weight and height.
- **Accurate BMI calculation**: Computes BMI using the standard formula.
- **Categorization of BMI results**:
  - Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
  - Normal weight (18.5 - 24.9)
  - Overweight (25 - 29.9)
  - Obese (BMI > 30)
- **Color-coded BMI scale**: Helps visualize BMI status.
- **Informative category reference**: Includes images and explanations for each BMI category.
- **Reset button**: Allows users to clear inputs easily.
- **Responsive design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. The user enters their weight (in kg) and height (in cm) into the provided input fields.
2. Clicking the "Calculate BMI" button triggers the PHP script to process the input.
3. The BMI is calculated using the formula:

   \[ BMI = \frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2} \]

4. The result is displayed with a corresponding category, message, and color-coded scale.
5. Users can reset the form using the "Reset" button.

## File Structure
```
- index.html   # Main frontend with the BMI form and UI elements
- styles.css   # Styling for UI elements (if applicable)
- script.php   # Backend logic for BMI calculation
- images/      # Contains images for BMI category reference
```

## Installation & Usage
### Requirements
- A local or online PHP server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a live server)

### Steps
1. Download and extract the project files.
2. Place all files in your server's public directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Start the PHP server.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
5. Enter your weight and height, then click "Calculate BMI" to view your results.

## Example Calculation
| Weight (kg) | Height (cm) | BMI  | Category   |
|------------|------------|------|------------|
| 70         | 175        | 22.9 | Normal     |
| 50         | 160        | 19.5 | Normal     |
| 85         | 170        | 29.4 | Overweight |
| 100        | 165        | 36.7 | Obese      |

## Future Improvements
- **Client-side validation**: JavaScript-based validation for improved user experience.
- **Live BMI calculation**: Display results dynamically without requiring form submission.
- **Dark mode support**: An option for users to switch to dark mode.
- **Improved UI enhancements**: Additional styling and animations for a modern look.
